===== Threaded Tree View v5.2.1.00 =====
Created by Brian Moon and updated by Joe Curia (azumandias _ at _ hotmail.com)
Original phorum coding by the Phorum Development Team (http://www.phorum.org)

========        Brief Description         ========
This module displays the threaded list view with tree lines similar to those used in Phorum 3.

========      Installation and Usage      ========
This module installs like any other module.

From the settings page you can customize the color and thickness of the tree 
lines.  Each template can have its own line color and thickness which will be 
displayed if you leave the settings empty.

If you have a custom template and want to use this module, you will need to 
create a folder in this modules's template folder and copy your template's 
list_threads.tpl and read_threads.tpl files into that folder.  Using the 
supported templates as examples add the necessary lines to the template files.
Those lines can be found in the supported templates after the 
<!--  Begin the Threaded Tree View customization  --> line.

Depending on the Phorum template you use as a base, I would suggest starting 
with that template's code.  Regardless, you may need to adjust the margins and
height values.

You will also need to create a settings.php file in your template's folder. I 
would again suggest copying this file frocm one of the supported templates. You 
will then need to adjust the line height and width.  If your template requires
further tweaking (such as for messages with a special icon which changes the 
height of their row) you can add php code to the four alloted modifier variables
in the settings.php file.  Examples of this can be seen in the Classic and 
Emerald templates.  It is important to note that if you do not use one of the 
modifier variables, it should still be supplied simply with an empty string.

The Classic, Emerald, and Lightweight templates are supported without 
any extra work on your part.
