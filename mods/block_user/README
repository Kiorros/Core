Module  : Block User
Author  : Thomas Seifert

Allows administrators to handle misbehaving or spammy users by:
- blocking them in a specific (sub-)forum (no post possible)
- blocking them in the whole phorum (no post possible)
- disabling them (no login possible)

- deleting all their posts

That action can be done by clicking a link in the user profile and selecting
the options on the followup page.


Installation:
-------------

- Unpack the archive;

- Move the directory "block_user" to the directory "mods"
  within your Phorum installation;

- Login as administrator in Phorum's administrative interface and
  go to the "Modules" section;

- Enable the module "Block User".


Notes:
------

As deleting all messages of a user is a time consuming task in the database 
the deletion is only done up to 100 messages for the user. Usually spam users
don't have that many messages (yet).
