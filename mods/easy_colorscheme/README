========            Brief Description           ========
This module allows you to create a color scheme, based on any template, preview
it, and apply it to your forum.  You can also save and reapply different schemes.

========         Installation and Usage         ========
This module installs like any other module, though it has a number of non-standard
files in its directory.  Make sure they are all included (see file list below).

When you first open this module it will pull the color variables from your currently 
applied template.  These colors will be saved to the "DefaultColors" scheme. Note that 
any colors found in the template that use a color name rather than the hexadecimal 
value will be converted to their respective hexadecimal values.  You can then change 
any color by selecting it or clicking in the color code field.  You can either click 
one of the colors shown in the color table provided or enter your own color names or 
hexadecimals values (be sure to include the #). Once you have chosen your colors you can 
save them as a color scheme then preview that scheme or apply it to your forum.  The 
currently applied global color scheme is always shown at the top of the settings page.

A note for those of you upgrading.  As a last case resort, You may find it easier to 
simply start your color schemes over from scratch if you run into problems.  To do so,
please open the settings for this module then paste the following into your web browsers 
address bar after the page information that is there:
&erase_easy_colorscheme=VERITABLY
The address should look something like:
http://www.yourweb.com/admin.php?module=modsettings&mod=easy_colorscheme&phorum_admin_token=1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9i0j&erase_easy_colorscheme=VERITABLY
Now hit ENTER and this will erase all of your color scheme settings.  Please note
this is irreversible so only do this if you have the need.  You can then rebuild
your color schemes and they should work just fine.

========                   Todo                 ========
